# Relative Pitch Perception Trainer ðŸŽ¼

This is a game to let develop an intuition for how different harmonic intervals feel and sound. You can choose what interval you want to train. The game will play a note, and you will control the pitch of a second note. You win when the two notes are the target interval apart.

For example, if the target interval is unison, and the game plays C4, you must move the slider until the second note is also playing C4.
If the target interval is a perfect fifth, and the game plays C4, you must move the slider until the second note is playing G4.

You must do this only using your hearing, you will not be told what note is playing.

Have fun! ðŸ˜Š
